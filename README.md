### So I built SweetD...

... a delivery service with an easy to access online website via mobile/desktop and an easy way for me to operate a business with Parse as the backend. (The name also generated a lot of smiles, so it was easy to remember)

It was my first website so, the code here isn't the cleanest, nor was it the most sensible way to build it, but I hold on to it because it was my first business venture and turned my initial investment of $80 into about $1000 within 6 weeks.

(Also I aplogize to any UI/UX designers, the website is pretty ugly)

The main feature of this system was an auto-generated SMS sent to delivery drivers that specified location, customer info, price, and the food included in the order. This made busy hours easier to manage and orders were able to be packed before delivery drivers returned, and allowed for more orders to be processed in a shorter amount of time.

I hired my housemates for a total of 2 drivers.

I deployed a marketing campaign on Facebook (which in all reality, simply consisted of about 1-2 ad campaigns and direct posts to all UCSC Facebook groups )


I closed the website after 6 weeks because school was over, and have left it closed because I moved to a location too far to be considered profitable due to gas costs.

There is a page that is still active if you wish to see it, but please request access to it because it is still hooked up to my phone for demo purposes.
